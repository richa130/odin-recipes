        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            When summertime gives you perfectly ripe and juicy tomatoes, one of the best ways to 
            enjoy them is also one of the easiest. Simply dice the tomatoes, season them with a 
            touch of salt, add a generous amount of good quality olive oil, and spoon the mixture 
            over thick slices of toasted or grilled bread. Congratulations, you've just made 
            bruschetta. This 5-star recipe for Balsamic Bruschetta shows you how to bump up that 
            basic tomato mixture with basil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, and Parmesan cheese; and 
            how to toast the bread in the oven â€” a good alternative if you don't have a grill or 
            the weather isn't grill-friendly.
